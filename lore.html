      <p>All characters created on Earth exist in the form of a cube,

        the releases or serialization of webtoons, the character's cube splits, 
        and a meteor is released, falling onto Caelum, where the character comes 
        to life in a Virtual World. If or when a character who is living in Caleum 
        loses their popularity, they disappear and return to the form of a cube and 
        then reside back in Asterum. [Revealed in Eunho's Birthday Kit QR code]

 <h3> "The 6th Summer" and Hamin's message</h3>      
    <span class="date"> August 24, 2023</span>
      <p>Before PLAVE’s Caligo Pt.1 comeback, a mysterious website, <a href= "https://lostmediasociety.net/home"> LMS </a> (Lost Media Society), was discovered. It contained details about 
        a now-forgotten webtoon artist, 3v3r, and a work titled The Sixth Track—not made by 3v3r, but by an impersonator. This webtoon 
        featured characters resembling the PLAVE members and used the same art style seen in “The 6th Summer” MV. Fans speculated that
        the MV was a retelling of the webtoon. VLAST further fueled theories by releasing a "SongHwi Art High School" notice about summer 
        safety, with QR codes seen in the MV posters leading to a terminal from Developer A. Fans decoded the terminal’s decrypted message
        to read: “Hello, I am Hamin”—sparking theories, especially since Hamin had not been publicly introduced before, he should have not
        been in both <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_yCRwh97M8&ab_channel=PLAVE%ED%94%8C%EB%A0%88%EC%9D%B4%EB%B8%8C"> "The 6th Summer" </a> MV and "The sixth Track" webtoon.

        <p> Fans interpret “The 6th Summer” as a story of grief, memory, and connection. The MV and album cover suggest that Hamin was the 
          only survivor of a summer countryside trip. In the MV, we see Bamby watching four birds fly away—perhaps symbolizing the other 
          members—and returning to an empty music room. Hamin’s lyrics and scenes portray themes of searching, loneliness, and transcending 
          space and time, likely referencing the rift and Asterum. Imagery like flooded classrooms suggests a drowning incident, while recurring
          marigold flowers—a symbol of remembrance and resilience—link to themes of mourning. The SongHwi school emblem and the album art also 
          feature marigolds. The MV ends with an alarm clock ringing and the marigold field blurring, possibly representing waking from a dream
          or regaining lost memories.

 <h3> Way 4 Luv and Introduction to Caligo </h3>

        whimsical buildings. A bulletin board appears, displaying a map, photos, and sticky notes outlining PLAVE’s mission to search for meteors or 
        star shards, symbolic of PLLI’s love. According to a live stream by Noah, these meteors actually help the trees grow, which explains why much
        of the MV is set in a forest. During the video, Noah presents a small cube—visually similar to the core cube Hamin used to gather the members
        in “Wait for You”—which transforms into a glowing pink heart. This heart, representing PLLI’s love, becomes the guide for their journey.

        <p> The final shot reveals five mysterious figures in black hoods—who are later identified as Caligo. Caligo was officially introduced through
          a QR code hidden in Yejun’s birthday kit. It was revealed that Caelum is more than just a planet—it has a will of its own. Caelum resurrects 
          certain characters who have disappeared and turns them into soldiers of its army, known as Caligo. These resurrected beings serve only Caelum’s 
          will, with the mission of capturing or containing characters who go out of bounds. This twist introduced a darker, opposing force into PLAVE’s universe.

        During this week, the Planets Parade was happening, which is a rare celestial event where the planets align in the night sky, making 
        the Earth in a straight line with Asterum. In the MV, we see the members staring out to the rift in the sky, which is now bigger than 
        we ever have seen it; the rift growing is a symbol of PLLI's love growing for PLAVE, which fits with the lyrics of Island.

 <h3> Chroma Drift back to the Archives </h3>      
    <span class="date"> February 3, 2025</span>
      <p>In the opening 20 seconds of the “Dash” MV, Caligo makes a direct appearance—marking their most visible threat yet. Revisiting the 
        LMS (Lost Media Society) archives reveals more of Bamby and Eunho’s backstory through the unreleased webtoon Chroma Drift.
        Set in the chaotic city of Maracaya, Chroma Drift follows the spread of an illegal potion called Chroma. The case remained open for 
        years with little known about its origins. Two rookie detectives—Bamby and Eunho—are assigned to investigate.
        <ul>
          <li>Episode 1: Eunho, a recent graduate from the Joint Police Academy, is transferred to Maracaya’s Central Investigation Bureau. 
            His noisy, energetic nature clashes with the stoic Bamby.</li>
          <li>Episode 2: Acting on a tip about a Chroma transaction site, the two attempt a mission but fail due to poor coordination. Eunho 
            grows suspicious of Bamby after noticing his exchanged glances with a with a member of the criminal organization.</li>
          <li>Episode 3 : Bamby ventures off alone to gather intel on Terry, a rumored member with electric powers.</li>
          <li>Episode 4 : Eunho secretly opens Bamby’s case file and discovers classified intel on Terry—triggering memories of a dark past tied to a secret enhanced-human lab.</li>

 <h3> MMMMM and Transmission Failures </h3>      
      <p>MaMiMuMo (also referred to as MMMMM) was revealed through a QR code in Noah’s birthday kit. Caelum had been running experiments to
        transmit Caligo soldiers into Asterum—where PLAVE resides—but repeated attempts failed. MMMM was the first partially successful 
        transmission, but due to an incomplete data transfer, the result was unstable. MMMM now appears briefly and randomly across space 
        and time, seemingly unbound by normal constraints. Eventually, Caelum perfected its transmission method, leading to Caligo soldiers 
        successfully infiltrating Asterum, as seen in multiple MVs.

 <h3> title </h3>      
    <span class="date"> February 3, 2025</span>
      <p>In  <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3GoZMfHJT4&ab_channel=PLAVE%ED%94%8C%EB%A0%88%EC%9D%B4%EB%B8%8C"> “Dash”</a> , when Eunho sees the first Caligo soldier, he runs to him, believing it to be Terry—his long-lost friend from Chroma Drift. 
        However, Terry had been resurrected by Caelum and turned into a Caligo. Now void of his identity, Terry serves only Caelum’s will. 
        Caligo’s mission: erase all unauthorized existence in Asterum, returning members to their original “cube” states.
        Asterum begins to crumble under Caligo’s attack.

        In a pivotal scene, Hamin is shown trapped in a digital, cube-like room, surrounded by monitors. This is speculated to be the central hub 
        from which he summoned the other members into Asterum. As the battle escalates, Hamin fends off Caligo agents and sends a desperate SOS
        signal to Developer A (the creator, also known as 3v3r).

      Another version of the “Dash” MV shows the members performing atop a glowing square—what fans believe to be an SSD drive—suggesting they’ve stored their data selves temporarily, awaiting rescue or reboot.
